# Vlad Tepes Tribute Page

## 📖 Overview

This project is part of my FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design certification.
The objective was to build a tribute page using only HTML and CSS.

I chose to honor Vlad Țepeș (Vlad the Impaler), the 15th-century ruler of Wallachia. While feared for his harsh punishments, he is also remembered in Romania as a strong leader who defended his land.

The page focuses on clean structure, semantic HTML, responsive design, and simple styling that adapts across devices.

## ✨ Features

- Responsive design that works on desktop, tablet, and mobile.

- Semantic HTML5 structure for accessibility.

- Styled headings, sections, and image with caption.

- Historical highlights about Vlad Țepeș (birth, reign, and death).

- A quote section with emphasis styling.

- External resource link for further reading.

- Footer credit section with developer link.
